    Sampled Session History of session 1 serial 44728
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 238 serial 55020
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 2 serial 31208
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 239 serial 36405
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 3 serial 27100
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 240 serial 3446
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 4 serial 13308
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 241 serial 3302
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 5 serial 35421
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 242 serial 20944
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 6 serial 16556
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 243 serial 5204
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 7 serial 57161
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 244 serial 5951
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 8 serial 19596
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 245 serial 35568
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 9 serial 17726
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 246 serial 63170
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 10 serial 40971
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 247 serial 60649
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 11 serial 7746
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 248 serial 48502
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 12 serial 36481
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 249 serial 18503
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 13 serial 35251
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 250 serial 17478
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 14 serial 19237
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 252 serial 376
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 15 serial 32760
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 254 serial 36680
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 18 serial 51345
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec

    Sampled Session History of session 237 serial 13043
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The sampled session history is constructed by sampling
    the target session every 1 second. The sampling process
    captures at each sample if the session is in a non-idle wait,
    an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a
    non-idle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples
    the session was in the same non-idle wait. If the
    session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for
    consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all
    the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive
    samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously
    idle or not in a wait (the sampling process does not know).
 
    The history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
 
    sample interval: 1 sec, max history 120 sec
